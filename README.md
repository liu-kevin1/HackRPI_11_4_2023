Graphing Guinea is a game designed and made for young students that are in the process of learning trigonometric equations.

In Graphing Guinea, the player must input an equation that will correctly bring Garry, the Graphing Guinea, to the other side safely.

Players are able to input basic trigonometric equations along with basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, in order to create a tunnel to ferry Garry to his goal.
